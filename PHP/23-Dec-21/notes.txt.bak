properties of constants:-
************************
1. by default the declaration of the constants are atomic,(declaration once) and case-Sensitive.
2. The scope of, constants are global.
3. The constants cannot be re-declared.
4. if we want to make in -case-Sensitive constantswe need to set 3rd argument in define as :true.
5. the in case-Sensitive, constants were depericated in version 7.4.16 but this feature is alerdy 
   supported. and in 8.x these feature again supported.
   
   Note: during this concept , we have two Error raised,

     E_DEPRECATED: reserved pre-defiend standards of php depericated error.
     E_USER_DEPRECATED:	reserved for user-defined depericated error.

*************************************
a variable in php can hold any type of string value, but in case of output string then,there is vast defference
B/W '' and "" its combinations.
these combinations are  invalid
1.''inside '' : invalid
2.""inside "" : invalid

these combination are possible:-
'' inside "" valid
"" inside '' valid
'' inside `` valid
"" inside `` valid

Note ::`` tick can inside '' or "" Qoutes only.

Types of output String:-
1.Raw String(single Qoutes) : any string wrapped inside '' will be Raw string.   in this case,
 escape character sequence like, \n,\t,\r,\v-vertical feed,\f-feed,\a-audible bell(tone),\b-backshalesh
 and variables are not processed.
  
2.Processed String(double Qoutes) : in case of processed, string every character within "" will be
 processed. any string wrapped inside "" Qoutes are called as processed string.
 and they will process, each and every specal character like escape sequences \n,\t,\f,\v,\r,\a
