it is  electrically convert into digital signal and stored in buffer by  bios
which can be used by Kernal(core of os) to internaly use this i/o value.
I/B: input buffer: storee all binary from of inputs takens from input devices which are digitally converted from 
 a anolog signal in from of current.
O/B:output buffer: stores all binary from of  outputs and a calulations calculated by AlU and  sent to primary 
memory which is then stored at output buffer which can be transferred to, any output devices.
