Note:-
we can use print_r() or var_dump to print the output of the array.
print_r():- prints the array or resource in, readable from it only show the data inside it.

it will dump the output entire data about the variable ,
hence var_dump shows the data, called(meta data) 
var_export() : Alias of var_dump(), same as var_dump but it show the representation of the data in more readable.
not meta data.

Empty:a empty is a, value(with no value)  having  type as string and length as zero, and ordinalty(Ascii)
as  0

what is the mejor different b/w null and undefined variable?
1. $x='a'; isset($x)--->return true.
2 echo $x; printf--->aboutif  you try these things with a undefined variable.
$y;
echo $y; // undifined variable $y.
since you are printing this with echo you will see nothing 
var_dump($y); // same  errror, undefined variable $y but, dta type Nu;;.

isset($y); false---> valid---> $y does not exist at all--> $y is given memory.
$z=null; // $z-->memory is allocated 
echo $z;  // no errror--> no output will be generated.
var_dump($z); //NULL without any error
isset($z);//false here $z is allocated into memory without any value.

unset($y);//deletes from the memory
echo $y;
unset($z); // deleted from the memory
echo $z; //undefined variable $z;

var_dump($y); //undefined variable-->null
var_dump($z);// no error-->null
unset($y);
unset($y);
var_dump($z);// undefined variable-->null
var_dump($y);// undefined variable-->null

Super global varriable:- these are special with global conntext, and scope and
these are predifined variable by php and it has been reserved, for some special purpose

Super Global variable are of two types:-
1.mangled super golbal variable.
2. non-mangled super Global variable.

super global variable in general 
$GLOBALS :non-mangled
$_SERVER :mangled
$_GET    :mangled
$_POST   :mangled
$_FILES  :mangled
$_COOKIE :mangled
$_SESSION:mangled
$_REQUEST:mangled
$_ENV    :mangled

other super global variable:-
$http_response_header :non-mangled
$argc                 :non-mangled
$argv                 :non-mangled
$php_errormsg         :Deprecated

Note mangled:which with $ and( _ )as prefixed
tjis naming convention is called name mangaling same thing is valid in 
python:__name__,__main__,__init(self)
In javascript:__proto__
